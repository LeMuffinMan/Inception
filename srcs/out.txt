mariadb  | Two all-privilege accounts were created.
mariadb  | One is root@localhost, it has no password, but you need to
mariadb  | be system 'root' user to connect. Use, for example, sudo mariadb
mariadb  | The second is mysql@localhost, it has no password either, but
mariadb  | you need to be the system 'mysql' user to connect.
mariadb  | After connecting you can set the password, if you would need to be
mariadb  | able to connect as any of these users with a password and without sudo
